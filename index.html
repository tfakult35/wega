        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>  > We are a diverse society of ethnologists, zoologists, historians and 
            paranormal researchers specialized in the study of global Vampirism.</p>
        <p>  > We believe the field of modern Vampyrology has been unjustly and systematically ostracized, 
            its pioneers excised from the scientific body, their life's work reduced 
            to a dozen moldy books hidden away in rotting bookshelfs of a few obscure libraries.
            Their legacy (if there even remains one) forever jeered on by men, who claim alliegence to
            Truth alone, yet are too blind to see anything which can not contort to their shallow materialistic
            worldview.  
        </p>
        <p>  > As the question of Vampirism has been rapidly increasing in relevance and urgency, we hope to enlighten
            as many as can be enlightened. The rest can burn in the hell they continue to sustain. We have long become
            apathethic to those whose hearts are closed to the Truth, on whom the Spirit of the Truth can not perch.    
        </p>  
        <p>  > On this site you can find the synthesized research of ours and of our predecessors. We understand that
            the Truth, no matter the dreadful feelings it induces within a man, will always be freeing, purifying, 
            deifying. Let this resource be a blazing hearth for you in this misty cold barren world.
