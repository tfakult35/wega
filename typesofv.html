    <h2>An Overview of Vampirism</h2>
    <p>The Vampire is a creature whose main form of sustenance subsits of feeding on the vital essence of living people.
        The English term 'Vampire' itself ultimately finds its origin in the Serbian 'vampir', transmitted through German.
        Despite this Vampirism is known throught out the world: 
        the Ashanti people of West Africa know of the Asanbosam with pink skin, long red hair and iron teeth;
        Nukekubi of Japan, which is said to dettach its head and hunt for human prey in the night; in Vietnam 
        there's the 'ma cà rồng' living among the humans, feeding on the blood of pregnant women during the night time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The different Vampiric creatures of folklore are embellished with local myths and superstitions,
        stemming from the material conditions of the peoples among whom the folk tales circulate; as is 
        expected with uncommon and traumatic phenomena. What these stories point to is an universal familiarity
        with cannibalistic humanoids, usually with animal traits, active mostly during the night.  
        In the orthodox scientific community, Vampirism is described only within the
        preconceived categories of psychiatric disorders and bodily diseases.
        This proves to be rather deficient in its ability to describe the full reality of the phenomenom. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Building on the work of our predecessors, the VRS has made great leaps in the study of these creatures.
        We know of two of types of Vampires: the Restless Vampire and the Akinetic Vampire. The exact relation
        between these two Vampire types is unknown. 

    </p>

    <article>
    <h3>The Restless Vampire</h3>
    <p> The Restless Vampire is characterized by a rather bloated appearance. 
        Their muscles are in a state of 
        permanent tension, which is reflected in their sputtery and startling movements.
        An overproduction of bodily fluids is often seen, with snot covering their mouth and chin and blood pooling 
        in their arms and legs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The behaviour of Restless Vampires is marked by the total inability of staying still, which they exhibit
        by stereotypical limb movement, rubbing their body against rigid objects such 
        parked cars or buildings, hitting themselves etc. Emotionally, they appear to be in a constant
        state of agitation. Communication is limited to echolalia and yelling obscenities.
    </p>
    <p>
        They know to only attack their prey when no one else is around. They overpower their victim, killing them with blunt trauma. 
        Without interruption, the Restless Vampire is able to eat a full grown adult male in two days. There is no pattern
        to the frequency of their attacks. 
    </p>
    </article>

    <article>
    <h3>The Akinetic Vampire</h3>
    <p>The Akinetic Vampires are pale, with lifeless and glassy eyes. They lay completely
        motionless when not hunting. There's no communication to speak off as they do not react to any outside stimuli, except 
        for the movement and reactions necessary for hunting down prey.
    </p>
    <p>
        They hunt for their prey every 6 months or so. Slowly slithering on the floor, hoping to find a house with
        an open window or balcony door and an unaccompanied child. They swallow their victims whole, stretching their 
        jaws to unnatural sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
        To great amazement, it has been observed that sometimes, in periods of long and complete stillness, the Akinetic Vampire will 
        levitate 5-10 cm off the ground. While levitating, their body still remains rigidly in the same laying position. 
    </p>
    </article>  
    <p>What connects these two types of Vampires is their solitary nature. The Vampire lives and hunts alone, lacking any need to
        search out and socialize with other Vampires. A Vampire family or other social group has never been observed. The only
        possible exception to this is a case of two Akinetic Vampires found laying across the room from each other in rural Serbia.
        It is a point of contention wheter this shows a social side of the Akinetic Vampire or the proximity of these 
        two Vampires is only the result of happenstance.
    </p>

    <p>Healthy people can become Vampires either seemingly sporadically, usually in a state of heightened psychological
        affect, or by contracting the affliction from another Vampire. The exact means of transmission of Vampirism
        is unknown, it likely differs in mechanism from that of ordinary infectious diseases, such as the common flu or rabies.
        It is unknown if person can be born a Vampire, however the pre-Vampiric state of many cases couldn't
        be accounted for. It is possible that some Vampires come in to the World fully formed by means yet unknown.
